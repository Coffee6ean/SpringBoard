# Python Libraries -

### Python Standard Library
Lots of useful data structures and features:
- queues and stacks
- binary search trees
- statistics
- complex numbers, fractions, cool math stuff
- functional programming helpers

### Beautiful Soup
A lot of sites have APIs that return data.
Many don’t, and you need to “scrape” HTML to get data.
Beautiful Soup is a terrific library for this.

### Common Data Science Libraries
- **Numpy**: Super-fast linear algebra and matrix math
- **Pandas**: Data slicing/grouping/querying
- **SciKit-Learn**: Common machine learning algorithms

[Good place to start](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/)

## Jupyter:
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) is “interactive computing”
- Like IPython in a web page
- Can mix in documentation, drawings, code snippets
- Often used to play with data or share analyses
- Can publish on the web
- Can even interactively edit as a group!
And it’s not just for Python :)

# Zen Of Python -
```
Beautiful is better than ugly
Readability counts

Explicit is better than implicit

Simple is better than complex
Complex is better than complicated

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules
Although practicality beats purity

Errors should never pass silently

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea
```
