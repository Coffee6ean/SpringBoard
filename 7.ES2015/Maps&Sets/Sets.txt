Sets - 
- All values in a set are unique - no duplicates
- Any type of value can exist in a set
- Created using the new keyword
- Exist in quite a few other languages, ES2015 finally brings them to 
    JavaScript

When would you use sets?
- Removing duplicate values
- Uniqueness required
- Efficiently checking if an item is in a collection (much better than arrays)
