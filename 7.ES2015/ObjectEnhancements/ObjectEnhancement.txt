Object Enhancements - 

Object Shorthand - 
Features that enhance the creation of objects and object literals.
ES2015 provides quite a few enhancements for JS objects. When keys are the 
same name, as the variable values, (this happens a lot), you don't have to
repeat yourself
    -> let firstName = "Mary"
       let lastName = "Mark"
    => let instructor = {
        firstName,
        lastName
       }

Shorthand Methods -
A nice shorthand when a key in an object represents a function. We do not
use arrow functions here
    => let instructor = {
        sayHello: function() {
            return "Hello";
        }
       }

Computed Property Names -
ES2015 allows us ton create an object wit a key taht JavaScript can compute
at definition.
    //ES5                                       //ES2015
    -> let firstName = "Mary";                  -> let firstName = "Mary"; 
    -> let intructor = {};                      -> let instructor = {
    -> intructor[firstName] = "That's me";          [firstName]: "That's me"
    => intructor.Mary;  //"That's me"              }
                                                => instructor.Mary;  //"That's me"
