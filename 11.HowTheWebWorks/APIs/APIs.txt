Working with API's - 

API (Application Programming Interface): 
An API is an interface or communication protocol between different parts
of a computer porgram intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance
of software.
An API may be for web-based system, operating system, database system, 
computer hardware, or software library.
An API specification can take many forms, but often includes specificactions
for routines, data structures, object classes, variables, or remote calls.
Documentation for the API usually is provided to facilitate usage and 
implementation.

More recently, the term has been often used to refer to a specific kind of 
interface between a client and a server, which has been described as a 
'contract' between both - such that if the client makes a request in a 
specific format, it will always get a response in a specific format or 
initiate a defined action. This is a specialized form of API, sometimes 
defined as a WEB API

WEB API:
When used in the context of web development, an API is typically defined
as a set of specifications, such as HTTP request messages, along with a 
definition of the structure of response messages, usually in an Extensible
Markup Laguage (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format

Third Part APIs:
Companies will provide access to their data (sometimes not for free)
- Twitter API, give me all tweets that mention "ice cream"
- Facebook API, send me the current user's profile picture
- Weather API, what is the weather in LA?
- GooglePlaces APLi, what gas stations are near the user?
- Yelp API, give me 10 restaurants inthe zipcode 94110

Summary - 
An API is a set of clearly defined methods of communictaion between various
components. An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database
system, computer hardware, or software library

XML and JSON -

Data Formats: 
- When we browse on the web, we make HTTP requests and get HTML back.
- API's don't respond with HTML
    - HTML contains info about page structure. API's respond with data, 
      not structure
- They use different data formats like XML and JSON
    - These are still text based formats - remember, HTTP is text based

XML: 
Syntactically similar to HTML, but does not describe presentation like HTML,
and many of the tags are custom
    -> <person>
        <name>Elie</name>
        <favoriteColor>purple</favoriteColor>
        <city>San Francisco</city>
       </person>

JSON:
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON looks similarf to JS objects,
but all the keys must be double-quoted (")
    -> {
        "person": {
            "name": "Elie",
            "favoriteColor": "purple",
            "city": "San Francisco",
            "favoriteNumber": -97,
            "interests": ["CEOing", "eating food"],
            "furtureDreams": null
        }
       }

Curl Requests -
'curl' is used in command lines or scripts to transfer data.
Simplest & most common request/operation made using HTTP is to GET a URL:
    -> $ curl https://curl.haxx.se
