# Node vs Browser JS - 

- Most programmatic behavior is exactly the same (yay v8!)
- The “global object” isn’t ***window***, it’s ***global***
    - This is where global vars go, where ***setTimeout*** is, etc
- Node doesn’t have ***document*** & DOM methods
- Node provides access to filesystem & can start server processes
- Many NPM libraries are “isomorphic” (can be used in web JS or Node)

## Looking Ahead:
**What’s Next**
- File I/O Exercise
- Writing our first servers with Express.js
