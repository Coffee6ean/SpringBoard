# Intro to Node.js -

- A JavaScript environment that runs server-side
    - It uses the Chrome v8 engine, but doesn’t require/use Chrome
- Can be used to build any kind of server-side JS
    - Including building web applications!
    - or as a general-purpose scripting language

### Why Node.js?
- The entire stack (frontend/backend) can be JavaScript
- There is an extensive set of add-on libraries via ***npm***
    - Many can also be used in client-side JS
- Widely used

### ***Starting Node***
```bash
$ node myScript.js
Hi there!
```

or, for an interactive REPL:

```bash
$ node
>
```

(***.exit*** or ***Control-D*** to return to the normal terminal)
