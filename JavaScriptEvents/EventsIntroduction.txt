What is an event?
DOM events are "actions" that occur as a result of something the user or the 
browser does (click, scroll, type, load, etc.).
We can use JavaScript to execute code when these kinds of "events" happen.
This is what most browser based JS is about - this is commonly called Event Driven
Programming

Event Listeners - 
Inline event listener:
The least preferred method since it clusters the HTML
    -> <h1 onclick="runClickHeader()">Hello World</h1>
    -> function runClickHeader() {
        console.log("You just clicked the h1 element")
       }

JS onclick:
Limited since you can only set/overrite the 'onclick' property. This means it is
not able to perform/listen to multiple events - it will only listen to the last one
    -> const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
    -> h1.onclick = function() {
        console.log("You just clicked the h1 element");
       }

addEventListener:
Preferred method isnce it's easier to later on remove an 'addEventListener' if we 
initially added it with this method - better adjustment lead to more scalability
    -> const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
    -> h1.addEventListener("click", function() {
        console.log("You just clicked the h1 element");
       });

Event Loading - 
If you are trying to access properties in the DOM, before the web page has loaded - 
it won't work. This becomes an issue if you put <script> tags in the <head> before the 
DOM has loaded.
Thankfully we have an event we can listen for to handle this, it's called 'DOMContentLoaded'
    -> document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        //place your code inside here
       })

Event Object -
Accessing the Event Object:
Inside of the callback to addEventListener, we get access to a special object as a 
parameter - the event object
    -> const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
    -> h1.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
        console.log(event);
       });

What is inside of the Event Object?
- target: what element is the target event
- pageX/pageY: where on the page did this event occur?
- key: what was pressed that triggered this event?
- preventDefault(): a function used to prevent the default behaviour of the event

Form Submission - 
The default action from the form is to refresh the web page
    -> <form>
        Name: <input id="firstName" type="text">
        <button>Add your name</button>
       </form>
    -> const formElement = document.querySelector("form");
    -> formElement.addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
        console.log("you just submitted the form");
       })

If we want to stop defualt behaviour of an event, we need to use the special 
'event.preventDefault()' method:
    -> const formElement = document.querySelector("form");
    -> formElement.addEventListener("submit", function() {
        event.preventDefault();
        console.log("you just submitted the form");
       })


Key Events -
Key Press:
    -> <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html>
       <body>
        <h1>Press the "a" key</h1>
        <script src="script.js></script>
       </body>
       </html>
    -> document.addEventListener("keypress", function(event) {
        if(event.key) {
            alert("you just pressed the 'a' key");
        }
       }); 

Multiple Events -

Event Delegation:
The event listener only works for elements currently on the page. There are two ways
we can fix this:
1. Adding the event listener when we create elements
    -> const form = documnet.querySelector("form");
       const friendList = document.querySelector("#friend-list");

       form.addEventListener("submit", function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        const newFriendInput = document.querySelector("#first-name");
        const newLi = document.createElement("li");
        const newButton = document.createElement("button");

        newLi.innerText = newFriendInput.value;
        newButton.innerText = "Remove";

        newButton.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
            event.target.parentElement.remove();
        });

        newLi.append(newButton);
        friendList.append(newLi);
        form.reset();
       })

    *This will work, but it's not the most efficient approach. We're adding an event 
    listener for every single button inside of each <li>

2. Event Delegation: The idea behind event delegation is that we make a parent element
    the "delegate" - in our case is the <ul>. We attach a single event listener on the
    parent or delegate element and them if the event happens inside a certain child
    element, we can access that child element using event.target
    -> friendList.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
        if(event.target.tagName === "BUTTON") {
            event.target.parentElement.remove();
        }
       });

Data Attributes -
When creating elements and HTML pages it's very common that you might want to add/store
some metadata or additional information about elements. These ara not things that user
should see, but accessible information in CSS and JavaScript.

Instead of placing this in an 'id' or 'class', we can create custom attributes called
data attributes. These attributes start with 'data-' and then anything you would like.
You can read them easily in CSS and JavaScript.
    -> <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html>
       <body>
        <ul id="cars">
            <li></option>
            <li data-model="model 3" data-year="2014">Tesla</option>            
            <li data-model="crv" data-year="2017">Honda</option>            
            <li data-model="focus" data-year="2011">Ford</option>
            <li data-model="prius" data-year="2015">Toyota</option>
        </ul>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
       </body>
       </html>
    -> const ul = document.querySelector("ul")
       ul.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
        const selectedElement = event.target;
        console.log("see all data attributes", selectedElement.dataset);
        console.log(
            "see one data attribute", 
            selectedElement.getAttribute("data-model")
        );
       });
