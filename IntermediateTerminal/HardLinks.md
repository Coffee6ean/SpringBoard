# Hard Links -
A ***hard link*** is essentially a carbon copy of the file that we're linking to.
So all chnages will be automatically updated or synced to the linked files.

A hard link perseveres through all sorts of trails, including the file path changing,
the directory changing for this link to file.

If in any case the original file is deleted, all other copy's will persist - they
will no longer stay up-to-date but they will remain.
