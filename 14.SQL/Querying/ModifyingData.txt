Modifying Data -

Creating data with *INSERT*:
-- Inserting a new book with title and author
    INSERT INTO books (title, author)
      VALUES ('The Iliad', 'Homer');
​
-- Inserting several books with titles only
    INSERT INTO books (title) VALUES
      ('War and Peace'),
      ('Emma'),
      ('Treasure Island');
​
Note: You can combine *INSERT* and SELECT to copy data from another table. 
    INSERT INTO books (title, author)
      SELECT title, author
        FROM some_other_table
        WHERE price < 10;
    
Updating data with *UPDATE*:
-- Matt is a prolific writer
    UPDATE books SET author = 'Matt';
​
-- JK, not that prolific!
    UPDATE books SET author = 'Jane Austen' WHERE title = 'Emma';

Deleting data with *DELETE*:
-- delete Emma
    DELETE FROM books WHERE title = 'Emma';
​
-- delete long books
    DELETE FROM books WHERE num_pages > 200;
​
-- delete all books!
    DELETE FROM books;
