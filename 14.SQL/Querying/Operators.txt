SQL Operators -

Operators are used to build more complicated queries They involve reserved 
SQL keywords. These include IN, NOT IN, BETWEEN, AND, and OR

An example:
-- basic WHERE clause
    SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = 'J. K. Rowling';
​
-- basic IN clause
    SELECT * FROM books WHERE id IN (1, 12, 30);
​
-- grab books of moderate length
    SELECT title, author
    FROM books
    WHERE page_count BETWEEN 300 AND 500;

Another example:
-- short, cheap books
    SELECT title, author
      FROM books
      WHERE price < 10
        AND page_count < 150;
    ​
-- new books or expensive books
    SELECT title, author, publication_date, price
      FROM books
      WHERE publication_date > '01-01-2017'
        OR price > 100;
    ​
-- books ordered by price
    SELECT title, price
      FROM books
      ORDER BY price;
