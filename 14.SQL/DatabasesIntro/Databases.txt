Introduction to Databases -

A database isa collection of data organized to be efficiently stored, 
accessed, and managed.
People will interchangeably use the term "database" to refer to database 
server software, the data records themselves, or the physical machine that 
is holding the data.

Databases in the Web Stack:

Client (Frontend):        Server (Backend):          Database(Backend):
- HTML/JS/CSS             - Flask                    - PostgreSQL
- jQuery                  - Django                   - MySQL
- React                   - Ruby on Rails            - SQLite
- Angular                 - Node.js/Express.js       - MongoDB
- Vue                     - Java Spring              - Cassandra

Relational Databases - Terminology:
- Model data as rows and columns of tabular data (like spreadsheets)
- Key Terms include:
    - RDBMS => Relational Database Management System, e.g PostgreSQL, 
        MySQL, Oracle, ...
    - schema => a logical representation of a database including tables
    - SQL => Structured Query Language, a human-readable language for 
        querying
    - Table (aka "relation") => basically a spreadsheet, a set of columns
        and rows
    - column => a table attribute, e.g "first_name", "last_name", or 
        "company"
    - row => a table record with values for set for columns, e.g 
        "Matt, Lane, Rithm"

Visualizing Tables:

Example 1: A Books Table
id | title                                           | author        | page_count
