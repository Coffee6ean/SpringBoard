Intro to Local Storage -

What is localStorage?
'localStorage' is a mechanisim for storing information in the browser for a specific
domain. When you read more about localStorage you will also hear about something
called 'sessionStorage'.

localStorage vs. sessionStorage:
- Data stored in localStorage has no expiration time
- Data stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the browsing session ends

Modifying localStorage-

The most important thing to remember is that all of your keys in localStorage or 
sessionStorage must be 'strings'.
localStorage stores everything as strings, so it's just good to get in the habit of 
setting your keys as strings to avoid confusion.

Setting an item in localStorage: We do this using the 'setItem' method
    -> localStorage.setItem("firstName", "Ben");
    -> localStorage.setItem("favoriteNumber, 17);
    -> localStorage.setItem("hasChickens", true);

Retrieving an item in localStorage: To retrieve we use the 'getItem' method (only
passing the key)
    -> localStorage.getItem("firstName");

Clearing localStorage: To delete a key we use the 'removeItem' function
    -> localStorage.removeItem("firstName");

To clear everything form localStorage we use the clear function:
    -> localStorage.clear();


Adding Ojects to localStorage - 
When we get the friends key from localStorage, we don't have an array anymore - we
have a string. Remember, when dealing with localStorage, everything gets converted 
into a string.
IN order to get back our original data type, we need to convert this array to a special
string format called JSON.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy
for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate

Working with JSON in the browser:
JavaScript has a built-in JSON object, and on this object are two methods to convert
JavaScript data into JSON, and to parse JSON strings into JavaScript:
- JSON.stringify: is used to convert JavaScript to JSON (or stringify)
- JSON.parse: parses a string as JSON

Using these two methods allows us to preserve the intended data structure when it is
something other than a string
    -> const friends = ["Lane", "Hayden", "Jessie"];
       //The JSON.stringify function
       // converts the friends array into a JSON string
       localStorage.setItem("friends", JSON.stringify(friends));
       //JSON.parse converts the JSON string
       // back into JavaScript(in this case, a valid array)
       JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("friends"));

Recap -
- localStorage is useful for storing information in the browser (not to be replaced for 
a standar server with a database)
- To store objects, use JSON.stringify when setting and JSON.parse when retrieving
- If you just wnat to store information for the time a tab is open, use sessionStorage
(as soon as that window closes, the tab is gone, that data is lost)
