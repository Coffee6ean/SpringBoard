# Testing is -
# - #1 thing employers ask us about
# - Something ALL engineers do
# - Automating the boring stuff
# - Fascinating and highly skilled art
# - Peace of mind: develop with confidence!


# Automated Tests Are Particularly Good For:
# - Testing things that “should work”
# - Testing the edge cases (anticipate the unexpected)
# - New things don’t break things that were working (“regression”)

# Kinds of Tests:
# Testing a Dryer:
# - 'Unit Test': does this individual component work?
# - 'Integration Tests': do the parts work together?
# - 'End-to-end Test': wet clothes → dry clothes?
#
# Some people call and include other notions of testing levels, like 
# “acceptance tests”, “system tests”, and others.
