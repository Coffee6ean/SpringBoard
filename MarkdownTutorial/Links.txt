Links -

There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render 
the exact same way. The first link style is called an inline link. To 
create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and 
then you wrap the link in parentheses ( ( ) ). For example, to create a 
hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, 
you'd write this in Markdown: [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com).

You can add emphasis to link texts, if you like. Although it might make 
for an awkward experience, you can make links within headings, too.

The other link type is called a reference link. As the name implies, the 
link is actually a reference to another place in the document. Here's an 
example of what we mean:

    Here's [a link to something else][another place].
    Here's [yet another link][another-link].
    And now back to [the first link][another place].

    [another place]: www.github.com
    [another-link]: www.google.com

The "references" above are the second set of brackets: [another place] and
[another-link]. At the bottom of a Markdown document, these brackets are 
defined as proper links to outside websites. An advantage of the reference
link style is that multiple links to the same place only need to be 
updated once. For example, if we decide to make all of the [another place]
links go somewhere else, we only have to change the single reference link.

Reference links don't appear in the rendered Markdown. You define them by 
providing the same tag name wrapped in brackets, followed by a colon, 
followed by the link.
