Paragraphs - 

Markdown has several ways of formatting paragraphs.

Let's take a few lines of poetry as an example. Suppose you want to write
text that looks like this:

    "Do I contradict myself?
    Very well then I contradict myself,
    (I am large, I contain multitudes.)"

Now, you might think that simply typing each verse onto its own line would
be enough to solve the problem:
    
    Do I contradict myself?
    Very well then I contradict myself,
    (I am large, I contain multitudes.)

Unfortunately, you'd be wrong! This Markdown would render simply as a 
single straight line

You can accomplish this by inserting two spaces after each new line. This
is not possible to see, since spaces are invisible, but it'd look 
something like this: Each dot ( · ) represents a space on the keyboard.

    Do I contradict myself?··
    Very well then I contradict myself,··
    (I am large, I contain multitudes.)
