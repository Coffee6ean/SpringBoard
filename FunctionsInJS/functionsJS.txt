Understanding functions is how you understand JavaScript

Goals -
1. Learn how JavaScript treats functions as first-class data types
- Most programming languages do not treat functions the same as
  other data types 
- JavaScript functions are considered first-class because theay are
  treated like any other data type
- In JavaScript a function is just an object (special kind)

Functions in JavaScript are first-class because of the following 3
features:
- Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
- The return value of a function can be another function
- A function can be assigned to a variable

2. Introduce callback functions
JavaScript is a single-threaded language - a thread represents a 
process, so in other words, a single process that executes one command
at a time. 
So how can we work around this? With Callback Queues 
(Alerts, Timers & Intervals)

Callstack = JavaScript to-do list / task manager
3. Explore a pattern for using callbacks to write declarative code
4. Introduce 'Anonymous' functions
An anonymous function is a name-less function; it can be passed to a
variable, but more often than not, we pass them to other functions

5. Understand the difference between synchornous and asynchronous 
    code
6. Learn about setTimeout and setInterval
- setTimeout: It's quite common to write code that we want to be 
    executed after a specific amount of time
