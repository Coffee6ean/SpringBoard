Pyhon Introduction (Backend/Server side Programming) -
- We've seen a lot of client-side stuff: HTML, CSS & JS
- It's time to see the other side
- There are tons of languages we could use to write server-side code with:
    - Ruby 
    - JS (Node)
    - PHP
    - Java
    - Python

The Game Plan - 
- Start by learning basic Python syntax: variables, loops, functions, etc.
- Move on to Object Oriented Programming in Python
- Learn how to create our own servers using Python
- Then, Python testing
- Take a detour to learn SQL and how to connect to a DB using Python
- Cover Authentication and deployment

Why Python?
- It's fast, powerful and widely used
- "High level": express concepts at a high level (a little more than JS)
- Super clean syntax
- Runs on servers (but not in browser)
- Particularly used for data science, machine learning, making servers, etc
