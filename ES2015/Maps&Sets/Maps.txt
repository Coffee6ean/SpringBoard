Data Structures in JavaScript - 
Data structures are formats for efficiently collecting or storing data.
Before JavaScript only had two types of data structures: Arrays and Objects

As of ES2015, we now have two new ones: Maps and Sets

Maps -
- Also called "Hash maps" in other languages
- Until ES2015, objects were replacement for maps
- Similar to objects, except the keys can be any data type

Why use maps?
- Finding the size is easy - no more loops or Object.keys()
- The keys can be any data type
