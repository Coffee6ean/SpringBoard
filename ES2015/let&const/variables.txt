var -
It used to be the only keyword to make a variable
- We used 'var' to create variables
- When defined in a function, the var keyword scopes a variable to that 
    function
- Function scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned

let -
- It can be reassigned but not redeclared (unlike var)
- The let keyword creates a 'block-scoped' variable: a variable that only
    exists inside a code block

const -
- The 'const' keyword prevents a variable from ever being reassigned or 
    redeclared
- const is also block-scoped, like let
