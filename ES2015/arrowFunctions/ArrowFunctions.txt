Arrow Functions -
- Arrow functions are shorthand for function expressions
- They cannot be named and they only work as function expressions
- They are ideal for shortening callbacks

Arrow functions have implicit return if you leave out the curly braces:
    -> let nums = [1,2,3];
    -> let arrSquared = nums.map(n => n ** 2);  //[1,4,9]

Gotcha with Arrow Function -
If you want to return an object, make usre it's wrapped in () or on more 
than one line.

Arrow Functions & 'this' - 
Arrow Functions do not have their own 'this' context. If your function uses
the keyword 'this', be wary.
You should not be using arrow functions:
- In an object method
- When you need your own keyword 'this'

Summary - 
- Can only be used as shorthand for anonymous function expressions
- Must put parentheses around parameters if there are no 0 or 2+ parameters
- Return statement is implied if you leave out the curly braces
- They do not make their own 'this'
