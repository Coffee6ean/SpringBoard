ECMAScript -
A standards organization for information and communication systems. ECMAScript
is based on several originating technologies, the most well-known being
JavaScript(Netscape) and JScript(Microsoft)
- The standard for the JS Language
- Started during the browser wars between Microsoft and Netscape
- Browsers/Node implement the language based on this standard

TC39 -
- Technical Committee 39 maintains and updates the ECMAScript standard
- They are 'in charge' of adding features
- They evaluate proposals for complementary or additional technologies

Evolving JS (The old way) -
- New features were batched together into large releases
- These releases were named with version numbers (ES3, ES5, etc.)
- Versions released infrequently, often with years between

Evolving JS (The new way) -
- Updates to the standard are published yearly
- Any new features ready each year are added together 
- Versions named by year (ES2016, ES2017, etc.)
- Introduced a new, formalized proposal process

Stage 0: Strawman
- It starts with an idea
- Non formal proposals live here

Stage 1: Proposal
- It's an 'official' proposal
- Polyfills/plugins will be introduced usually at this time

Stage 2: Draft
- Still a bit too early for us to cover
- Sometimes implementers will experiment adding this to browsers/environments

Stage 3: Candidate
- Proposals in this stage are candidate recommendations
- Unlikely to change beyond fixes to issues identified in the wild
- Proposals move this level with at least one browser implementation or when
    supported by a build-time transpiler like Babel

Stage 4: Finished
- Proposals get to this stage when there are at least two independent 
    implementations that pass acceptance tests
