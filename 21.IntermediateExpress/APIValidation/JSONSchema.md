## JSON Schema Basics -

- JSON Schema is a standard specification for describingÂ JSON in a human and machine-readable format.
- We can auto-generate validation from sample data
- We can do this atÂ [JSONschema.net](https://jsonschema.net/)

### JSONschema.net
- To get started, paste the JSON in left box and submit
- Resulting JSON schema from our input is in HTML tab
- You can edit directly on the website
- If weâ€™d like, we can manually edit the schema.
- We can now copy and paste this into into anyÂ ***.json***Â file
- We will be importing thisÂ ***.json***Â file as our validator

### Using the JSONSchema NPM Package in Express
Weâ€™ll be using the jsonschema npm package (links: npm and github).

- Install the package usingÂ `npmÂ installÂ jsonschema`
- You import the validator.
- You supply the validator with a schema.
- You pass instances of user input to the validator.
- The validator checks if user input is valid against schema.
- If invalid, you respond with errors. Otherwise continue.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** When you ask JSONSchema to infer a schema for you, it makes guesses as to the types of basic validation. But there are more advanced types of validation you can add directly from the interface.

For example, you can set a min or max length on strings, or verify that strings adhere to certain formats via theÂ *format*Â key (e.g. emails or URLs). You can click on a property to see what sorts of validations are available.

### The steps
_demo/routes/books.js_
```js
const jsonschema = require("jsonschema");
const bookSchema = require("../schemas/bookSchema.json");

router.post("/with-validation", function(req, res, next) {
  const result = jsonschema.validate(req.body, bookSchema);

  if (!result.valid) {
    // pass validation errors to error handler
    //  (the "stack" key is generally the most useful)
    let listOfErrors = result.errors.map(error => error.stack);
    let error = new ExpressError(listOfErrors, 400);
    return next(error);
  }

  // at this point in code, we know we have a valid payload
  const { book } = req.body;
  return res.json(book);
});
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Note:** In our current example, the error we send back to the client if the schema validation fails is just a single string with all of the individual failure messages concatenated together.

This may not be the most helpful way to send back errors to the client. If youâ€™re curious, you can spend some time in the next lab thinking about other ways to send multiple error messages back when the schema validation fails.

### Things to be aware of!
- Validation can be quite strict, so take care when setting up schema
- As you add new fields/columns, make sure you update schema
- You may want different schemas for updating/creating

### Weâ€™re just scratching the surface
- You can create extremely robust validation systems with JSONSchema
- You can customize almost everything, from type to error message
