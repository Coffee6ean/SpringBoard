1. What is Git?
Git is a tool that allows developers to track versions of their code over 
time.
It does this by creating 'snapshots' of the current state of the code base
whenever you tell it to - this is what makes Git essential when collaborating
with other developers to ensure the previous 'snapshots' of the code can be
revisited if necessary.

'VCS' is a common acronym that stands for Version Control System. Git is a 
VCS because it lets you create different versions of your code and easily
swap back and forth between different versions 
Git and GitHub are different
