1. What is Bash?
Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating 
system. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’, a pun on 
Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh,
which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.

While the GNU operating system provides other shells, including a version
of csh, Bash is the default shell.

2. What is shell?
The shell is the program which actually processes commands and returns output.
Most shells also manage foreground and background processes, command history 
and command line editing.
These features (and many more) are standard in 'bash', the most common shell in
modern linux systems.

3. What is a terminal?
A terminal is an application that gives us command line interface (or CLI)
to interact with the computer. Text-based interface

A terminal refers to wrapper program which runs a shell.
Decades ago, this was a physical device consisting of little more than a monitor
and keyboard.
As unix/linux systems addes better multiprocessing and windowing systems, this 
terminal concept was abstracted into sofware.

In terminal, all files and folders begin at the root directory. The root
directory is noted by a '/'.

- Root directory:
    Inside the root directory are essential files/folders that your machine needs,
    but we do not modify the files and folders in the root directory often
- 'Users' folder:
    Inside the root directory, we have a folder called 'Users' which contains all 
    of the user accounts on your computer. If you move into the directory for your
    user account, you will be in the 'home' directory, which is denoted by '~'


Introduction to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) -
WSL allows the user to install and run Linux within Windows

Linux commands -
- explorer.exe .: Interact and access linux files/folders from windows terminal
- pwd: "Print Working Directory", will display the absolute path and let you know
        what current directory is being worked on
- cd: "Change Directory", will move the user to de declared path/name
- cd ~: Will move the user to their respective home directory 
- cd ..: revert one level of directory 
- ls: "List", will list all 'visible' files in current directory
- ls -a: "List All", will list all files in current directory (visible or otherwise)
- ls -l: Will list all 'visible files with file permissions, link number, owner name, 
        name of the group it belongs to, size in bytes , a timestamp and file name
- ls -al: Same as last point, but for all files (visible or otherwise)
- cd /mnt/c: Interact and access windows files/folders from linux server side
- mkdir: "Make Directory", command to create a folder 
- touch: Command to create a file [file_name + file_typ]. If file already exists, it
        will only change the file's meta data
- cat: "Concatenate", alllows the user to display the contents of a file without 
        having to open it - view in terminal
- echo: Command will simply write the typed text in the terminal
- >: "Redirect", will redirect the output from the command on the left side into the
        file on the right hand side -> [echo "" > file_name] will fill in the file, 
        overwritting all the previous contents 
- rm: "Remove", command to remove a file 
- rmdir: "Remove Directory", command to remove (empty) directories 
- rm -rf: Command to remove folder with all contents, regardless of their user
        permission
- open: "Open", will open a file or directory 
- .: Reference to current directory 
- mv: "Move", to move files and folders [mv test.txt ../] - This command can also be
        used to rename a file [mv test.txt newTest.txt]
- cp: "Copy", command to copy a file [cp PATH_TO_ORIGINAL_FILE PATH_TO_COPIED_FILE]
- cp -r: Command to copy an entire directory to another

Linux Shortcuts -
- Command/Ctrl + A: Move to beginnig of line
- Command/Ctrl + E: Move to the end of the line
- Command/Ctrl + W: Delete the word up to where the cursor is 
- Command/Ctrl + U: Delete an entire line
- Option/Alt + left/right: Jump between words


A path is simply the way to reach a fila or a folder; it's like an address for the
file or folder you're trying to reach.
If you use 'cd' with an absolute path you can move from anywhere to anywhere, but,
if you use 'cd' with a relative path the file/folders must be located relative to 
where you're located.

Flags -
Flags can change and even enhance commands and are added using a '-' after the 
command. Flags are usually represented by single uppercase and lowercase letters.

If you ever want to learn more about a terminal command you can use the 'man' 
command followed by the terminal command to see a manual on the command
