Blockquotes - 

If you need to call special attention to a quote from another source, or 
design a pull quote for a magazine article, then Markdown's blockquote 
syntax will be useful. A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been
specially formatted to draw attention to the reader.

To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the 
"greater than" caret (>).

You can also place a caret character on each line of the quote. This is 
particularly useful if your quote spans multiple paragraphs. For example:
    > His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature. Had he spoken
    of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be? Stephen watched his face for some
    moments in silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, of his own
    loneliness which he feared.
    >
    > â€”Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length.
    >
    > Cranly did not answer.
