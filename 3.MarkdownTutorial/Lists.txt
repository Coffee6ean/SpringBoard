Lists - 

There are two types of lists in the known universe: unordered and ordered.
That's a fancy way of saying that there are lists with bullet points, and
lists with numbers.

To create an unordered list, you'll want to preface each item in the list
with an asterisk ( * ). Each list item also gets its own line. 
For example, a grocery list in Markdown might look like this:

    * Milk
    * Eggs
    * Salmon
    * Butter

An ordered list is prefaced with numbers, instead of asterisks. Take a look at this recipe:

    1. Crack three eggs over a bowl
    2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl
    3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter
    4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl

You can choose to add italics, bold, or links within lists, as you might
expect.

Occasionally, you might find the need to make a list with more depth, or,
to nest one list within another. Have no fear, because the Markdown 
syntax is exactly the same. All you have to do is to remember to indent 
each asterisk one space more than the preceding item.

    * Calculus, 
        * A professor
        * Has no hair
        * Often wears green
    * Castafiore
        * An opera singer, 
        * Has white hair, 
        * Is possibly mentally unwell

While you could continue to indent and add sub-lists indefinitely, it's 
usually a good idea to stop after three levels; otherwise, your text 
becomes a mess.
