Italics and Bolds -

We'll start by learning two basic elements in text formatting: italics and
bold. In these lessons, you'll notice some formatted red text; this text 
is actually written in Markdown! Regular Markdown doesn't look any 
different than regular text, but we're providing some highlighting to make
it easier to see.

To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an 
underscore (_ ). For example, _this_ word would become italic.

Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with 
two asterisks ( ** ). This will **really** get your point across.

Of course, you can use _both italics and bold_ in the same line. You can 
also span them **across multiple words**.

For the final exercise in this lesson, we're going to make some words bold and italic.

In general, it doesn't matter which order you place the asterisks or 
underscores. In the box below, make the words "This is unbelievable" both 
bold and italic. Place the asterisks **_on the outside_**, just to make 
it more legible.
