Headers -

Headers are frequently used on websites, magazine articles, and notices, 
to draw attention to a section. As their name implies, they act like 
titles or subtitles above sections.

To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#).
You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want.
For example, for a header one, you'd use one hash mark (# Header One), 
while for a header three, you'd use three (### Header Three).

It's up to you to decide when it's appropriate to use which header. 
In general, headers one and six should be used sparingly.

You can also mix and match inline styles within headers, such as italicizing
them.
