Images - 

If you know how to create links in Markdown, you can create images, too. 
The syntax is nearly the same.

Images also have two styles, just like links, and both of them render the 
exact same way. The difference between links and images is that images are
 prefaced with an exclamation point ( ! ).

The first image style is called an inline image link. To create an inline
image link, enter an exclamation point ( ! ), wrap the alt text in brackets
( [ ] ), and then wrap the link in parentheses ( ( ) ). (Alt text is a 
phrase or sentence that describes the image for the visually impaired.)

For example, to create an inline image link to 
https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png, with an alt text that says,
Benjamin Bannekat, you'd write this in Markdown: 
![Benjamin Bannekat](https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png).

Although you don't need to add alt text, it will make your content 
accessible to your audience, including people who are visually impaired, 
use screen readers, or do not have high speed internet connections.

For a reference image, you'll follow the same pattern as a reference link.
You'll precede the Markdown with an exclamation point, then provide two 
brackets for the alt text, and then two more for the image tag, like this:
![The founding father][Father] At the bottom of your Markdown page, you'll
define an image for the tag, like this: [Father]:
