# State vs Props

A common question: what belongs in state and what belongs in props?

If the data will ever change, it needs to be in state!

### Example: Let’s build a game!

- If we want to build a game with a board, we might want a component called ***GameBoard***.
- ***GameBoard*** will have a score - props or state?
- ***GameBoard*** will have a certain numRows - props or state?
- ***GameBoard*** will have a certain numColumns - props or state?
- ***GameBoard*** will display text if the game is over - props or state?
