# Cleaning up an Effect

In our previous example, we only fetched data on mount and on update, but itâ€™s very common to handle events when the component will be removed from the DOM. Some common examples include

- clearing intervals or timeouts
- removing an event listener
- unsubscribing
- disconnecting from a socket

### Cleanup with useEffect
To do this, we return a function from useEffect!

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // runs on the first render and all times after
  // because we didn't pass in an array as a 2nd arg!
  console.log('Effect ran!');

  // if we return a function
  // it will run when the component unmounts
  // or before the effect runs again
  return () => console.log('in the cleanup phase!');
})
```
