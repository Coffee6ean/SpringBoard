# When Should I Write My Own Hooks?

### General Tips
You don’t *have* to write custom hooks, but there are a number of situations where they can be useful.

- Same business logic inside of multiple components? Maybe a custom hook can help.
- Business logic cluttering up a single component? Maybe a custom hook, even if only for one component, can help with readability.
- Don’t start by asking what custom hooks you need; lean on custom hooks to help you refactor your code.
