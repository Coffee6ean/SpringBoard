# Things to Think About -

### Whiteboarding Is A New Skill
- It’s not the same as programming
- The first few times, your brain will fall out
- Like any skill, it takes time — practice!

### Partial Credit
- It’s not pass/fail
- Do what you can,
    - even if it’s only pseudocode
    - even if it’s a simpler case
    - even if it’s just 1 part of the problem
- They want to see how you think
- They want to see how you handle pressure
- Sometimes, the questions are *really hard*
- They typically don’t want you to solve it with a built-in function
    - eg, for “find max number,” you can’t use `Math.max()`
    - You can get partial credit/bonus point by knowing ***Math.max()*** exists

### Don’t Go Radio Silent
- It’s fine (good, even!) to stop and think
    - Don’t go entirely silent for too long — let them know where you are
- Use the whiteboard for scratch space
    - Helps keep you organized
    - Helps them see where you are

### Hints
- It’s fine to ask for a hint
- Some questions are designed so that’s expected
- If you know part of the answer, say that before asking for help

### Good Variable Names
- Think for a second before writing down
    - You want something short but helpful
- Good rules of thumb:
    - For *indexes of list*: ***i***, ***j***, ***k***
    - For *items in list*: ***a***, ***b***, ***c*** (or ***x***, ***y***, ***z***)
    - Use mnemonics: ***n*** for number, ***s*** for string, etc

### Test, Don’t Hand-Wave
- Some parts are hairy and you might feel shaky
- It’s easy to try to “hand-wave” past them
    - “And now I recurse and find the longest string”
- Resist that temptation
    - The parts you’re less sure of need the slowest testing
    - Be the computer

### It’s Not an API Quiz
- Try to remember the very most common operations
    - eg, to add to an array, it’s ***myArray.push()***
- But whiteboarding isn’t an API pop quiz
    - It’s ok to ask what a method is called
    - It’s ok to use a best-guess name (***mySet.additem()***)
- They want to test your thinking, not memorization of APIs!

### Take Your Time
- Interviewers will not be checking watches
- They want you to think deeply
- Don’t let nerves speed up your speech

## Remember:

- You have a useful, new skill
- They’re hungry for people they can hire – they want you to succeed!
- Think of them as a “pair programming partner”, not a “test proctor”
- Think first, go slow, code out loud, test your work
