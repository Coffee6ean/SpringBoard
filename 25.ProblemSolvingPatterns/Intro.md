# Problem Solving Process and Patterns -

## Goals:

- Develop problem solving process & learn fundamental patterns
- Use frequency counters to solve problems more efficiently
- Use multiple pointers to solve problems more efficiently
- Compare different runtimes

## Developing a problem solving process: 

### The process
1. Understand the Problem
2. Explore Concrete Examples
3. Break It Down
4. Solve a Simpler Problem
5. Use Tools Strategically
6. Look Back and Refactor

### 1. Understand the Problem
- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- Do I have enough information?
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

### 2. Explore Concrete Examples
- Start with Simple Examples
- Progress to More Complex Examples
- Explore Examples with Empty Inputs
- Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs

### 3. Break It Down
- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
- You can type this as pseudocode or write it on a whiteboard (or desk)
- This forces you to think about the code youâ€™ll write before you write it
- This helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings
- Donâ€™t write code!

### 4. Solve A Simpler Problem
> *If there is a problem you canâ€™t solve, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it.*

- Find the core difficulty in what youâ€™re trying to do
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Then incorporate that difficulty back in

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Easier said than done.**
This fourth strategy (solve a simpler problem) is easier said than done. If you simplify too much, you may make the problem too simple, in which case solving the simpler problem provides little insight into the original. But if you donâ€™t simplify enough, you still might be stuck on a problem that is too challenging. Finding the right sub-problem to isolate takes a decent amount of practice.

### 5.Use Tools Strategically
- Use your debugging tools.
- Donâ€™t guess and check!
- Scientific approach: formulate hypotheses, test, draw conclusions. Repeat.

### 6. Look back and refactor
- Does the result match your expected output?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- What other ideas could you have pursued?

### Now that you have the planâ€¦.
- The only way to get better is to practice using this plan!
