AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) -

Traditional Requests:
- Entering a URL in the browser bar 
- Clicking on a link
- Submitting a form

In all cases:
- Browser makes request 
- Receives response 
- Replaces entire 'resource' with result

AJAX:
AJAX is a technique in JavaScript for sending requests and receiving 
responses from a server without having to reload the browser page

AJAX web request:
- Made from JavaScript in browser 
- JavaScript makes request (GET, POST, or other)
- You receive a response 

Why use AJAX?
- Don't need to relaod entire page if just 1 thing is changing
- Interactive web sites 
- Fewer fill page loads from server 
    - Your JS can talk to other servers directly 
- Less info has to go across network

XMLHttpRequest -
Use XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects to interact with servers. You can retrieve
data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a 
web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is
doing

Starting a Server - 
We can use python:
  -> python3 -m http.server

We can use VSCode extension
