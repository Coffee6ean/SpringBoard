AJAX with Axios - 
Third-party library

What's a promise?
- We'll talk about it in more detail when we get to Node
- For now, all you need to know is that a promise is like a placeholder
    for a future value
- We want to wait for the promise to have that value before proceeding
- But we don't know when the promise will receive its value

Async and Await -
Asynchronicity: AJAX requests are asynchronous
- The axios.get() completes before the response is received
- This means that if we want to use the data we get back from our AJAX
    requests, we need to wait until the response has been given to us

Multiple Requests - 

Error Handling - 

Axios API - 
- .get: 'axios.get(url, [config])', 'config' is an optional object many 
    Axios methods use. It holds sepecific configuration for what you need.
    To make requests for '/resource?a=1&b=2', we can either use:
    -> axios.get('/resource?a=1&b=2');
    -> axios.get('/resource', {params: {a: 1, b:2}});
    *Second form is better: you don't have to worry about how to "url safe
    quote" characters that aren't normally legal in URLs

- .post: similar to 'axios.get', but uses a post request
    -> axios.post(url, [data, ] [config])
