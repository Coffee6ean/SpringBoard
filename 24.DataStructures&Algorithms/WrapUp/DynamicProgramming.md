## Dynamic Programming

Some problems have *overlapping subproblems* (it’s easier to solve them once, rather than keep solving again and again)

Dynamic programming is a mix of recursive thinking and memoization

Classic example is “Fibonacci sequence”:

- Starting with 1 and 1
- Next number is sum of two previous numbers
- `1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ...`
